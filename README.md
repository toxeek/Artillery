# Artillery

###  Just a test repository with scenarios and test loads 

#### Artillery has a *quick* command, so you can do something like this from the command line: (GNU/Linux used):
```bash
$ artillery quick --count 10 -n 20 https://artillery.io/
 ```

 #### In order torun the test.yaml:
 ```bash
$ artillery run --output report.json test.yaml
```

 This is under construction, hopefully more mock tests will be added and a Rakefile, etc..
